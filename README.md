🏆 Digital Design Using Verilog
📌 Overview
This repository contains various digital design projects implemented using Verilog HDL. The goal is to develop a strong foundation in digital logic design, simulation, and FPGA-based implementation. Each project includes Verilog source code, testbenches, and simulation results.

Edit

cd digital-design-verilog  
Open the Verilog files in Vivado or any other HDL simulator.
Run testbenches to verify the functionality.
Synthesize the design for FPGA implementation (if applicable).
🛠 Tools Used
Xilinx Vivado – Design simulation & synthesis
Cadence Virtuoso – (Optional) For layout design
GTKWave – Waveform analysis (for some testbenches)
📜 Projects Included
Basic Logic Gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR)
Multiplexer & Demultiplexer
Encoders & Decoders
Flip-Flops & Registers
Counters (Up, Down, Up-Down)
ALU Design (Arithmetic & Logical Operations)
FSM-based Controllers
